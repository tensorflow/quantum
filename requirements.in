# Contourpy 1.3.3 requires Python >= 3.11, so we need to limit to 1.3.2.
contourpy<=1.3.2
numpy<2.0
# SciPy 1.13 allows for NumPy 2.x, which leads to conflicts at install time.

tf-keras~=2.16.0

# TODO: the next ones are not truly core requirements. A better place should be
# found for them (long with others needed by scripts/*). They're here as a
# stop-gap measure until then.
