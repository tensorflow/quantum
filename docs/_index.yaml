      description: >
        TensorFlow Quantum (TFQ) is a python framework for hybrid
        quantum-classical machine learning that is primarily focused on
        modeling quantum data. TFQ is an application framework developed to
        allow quantum algorithms researchers and machine learning applications
        researchers to explore computing workflows that leverage Googleâ€™s
        quantum computing offerings, all from within TensorFlow.
