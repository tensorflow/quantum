        <p>
        TensorFlow Quantum (TFQ) is a
        <a href='./concepts'>quantum machine learning</a> library for rapid
        prototyping of hybrid quantum-classical ML models. Research in
        quantum algorithms and applications can leverage Google’s quantum
        computing frameworks, all from within TensorFlow.
        </p>
        <p>
        TensorFlow Quantum focuses on <em>quantum data</em> and building
        <em>hybrid quantum-classical models</em>. It integrates quantum computing
        algorithms and logic designed in
        <a href="https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq" class="external">Cirq</a>,
        and provides
        quantum computing primitives compatible with existing TensorFlow APIs,
        along with high-performance quantum circuit simulators. Read more in the
        <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02989" class="external">TensorFlow Quantum white paper</a>.
