      description: >
        <p>TensorFlow Quantum (TFQ) is a Python framework for hybrid
        quantum-classical machine learning. As an application framework, TFQ
        allows quantum algorithm researchers and ML application researchers to
        leverage Googleâ€™s quantum computing frameworks, all from within
        TensorFlow.</p>
        <p/>TensorFlow Quantum focuses on modeling quantum data. It provides
        tools to interleave quantum algorithms and logic designed in
        <a href="https://cirq.readthedocs.io/" class="external">Cirq</a>
        with TensorFlow. A basic understanding of quantum computing is required
        to effectively use TensorFlow Quantum.</p>
        <p>To get started, read the <a href="./overview">overview</a> and
        <a href="./design">design and concepts</a> guide, then run the
        <a href="./tutorials/hello_many_worlds">tutorials</a>.</p>
