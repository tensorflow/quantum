# TensorFlow Quantum

TensorFlow Quantum (TFQ) is a Python framework for hybrid quantum-classical
machine learning. As an application framework, TFQ allows quantum algorithm
researchers and ML application researchers to leverage Google’s quantum
computing frameworks, all from within TensorFlow.

TensorFlow Quantum focuses on modeling quantum data. It provides tools to
interleave quantum algorithms and logic designed in
<a href="https://cirq.readthedocs.io/" class="external">Cirq</a> with
TensorFlow. A basic understanding of quantum computing is required to
effectively use TensorFlow Quantum.

After Google's
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1666-5" class="external">quantum supremacy</a>
milestone, the
<a href="https://research.google/teams/applied-science/quantum/" class="external">Google Quantum AI team</a>
is focused on developing and implementing new algorithms to run on a quantum
computer—that have

To get started with TensorFlow Quantum, see the [install guide](install.md) and
read through some of the runnable
[notebook tutorials](./tutorials/hello_many_worlds.ipynb).

## Design

TensorFlow Quantum implements the components needed to smoothly integrate
TensorFlow with quantum computing hardware. To that end, TensorFlow Quantum
introduces two datatype primitives:

- *Quantum circuit*: This represents Cirq-defined quantum circuits within
  TensorFlow. Create batches of circuits of varying size, similar to batches of
  different real-valued datapoints.
- *Pauli sum*: Represent linear combinations of tensor products of Pauli
  operators defined in Cirq. Like circuits, create batches of operators of
  varying size.

Using these primitives to represent quantum circuits, TensorFlow Quantum
provides the following operations to developers:

- Sample from output distributions of batches of circuits.
- Calculate the expectation value of batches of Pauli sums on batches of
  circuits. TFQ implements backpropagation-compatible gradient calculation.
- Simulate batches of circuits and states. While inspecting all quantum state
  amplitudes directly throughout a quantum circuit is inefficient at scale in
  the real world, state simulation can help researchers understand how a quantum
  circuit maps states to a near exact level of precision.

For more details about TFQ design choices and implementation, read the
[Design and concepts](design.md) guide.
