Using the same circuits as McClean et al., the authors propose a different initialization technique for the classical control parameters to avoid barren plateaus. The initialization technique starts some layers with totally random control parameters—but, in the layers immediately following, choose parameters such that the initial transformation made by the first few layers is undone. The authors call this an *identity block*.\n",

This allows the user to pick and choose which variables and blocks to modify to get a strong gradient signal. This heuristic does not prevent the user from falling in to a barren plateau during the training phase (and restricts a fully simultaneous update), it just guarantees that you can start outside of a plateau."

Initially $\\theta_{1a}$ and $\\theta_{1b}$ are the same angles but they are learned independently. Otherwise, you will always get the identity even after training. The choice for the number of identity blocks is empirical. The deeper the block, the smaller the variance in the middle of the block. But at the start and end of the block, the variance of the parameter gradients should be large. "

In the figure below (from the paper), each colored line represents the variance of the gradients of the first three parameters of their model used in the QNN classification task as it was trained over time. As you can see, the initial variances are well above the barren plateau line, but do gradually slope downwards. All of the instances run here did avoid barren plateaus.\n",
