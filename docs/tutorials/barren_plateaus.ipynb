    "\n",
    "An interesting heuristic by <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.05076.pdf\" class=\"external\">Grant, 2019</a> allows one to start very close to random, but not quite. Using the same circuits as McClean et al., the authors propose a different initialization technique for the classical control parameters to avoid barren plateaus. The initialization technique starts some layers with totally random control parameters—but, in the layers immediately following, choose parameters such that the initial transformation made by the first few layers is undone. The authors call this an *identity block*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of this heuristic is that by changing just a single parameter, all other blocks outside of the current block will remain the identity—and the gradient signal comes through much stronger than before. This allows the user to pick and choose which variables and blocks to modify to get a strong gradient signal. This heuristic does not prevent the user from falling in to a barren plateau during the training phase (and restricts a fully simultaneous update), it just guarantees that you can start outside of a plateau."

    "\n",
    "To generate an identity block and train the model, generally you need $U1(\\theta_{1a}) U1(\\theta_{1b})^{\\dagger}$ and not $U1(\\theta_1) U1(\\theta_1)^{\\dagger}$. Initially $\\theta_{1a}$ and $\\theta_{1b}$ are the same angles but they are learned independently. Otherwise, you will always get the identity even after training. The choice for the number of identity blocks is empirical. The deeper the block, the smaller the variance in the middle of the block. But at the start and end of the block, the variance of the parameter gradients should be large. "
