Instructions to create and intsall TensorFlow Quantum as a PIP package:

First create a Docker container with Ubuntu 16.04 and the devtoolset7 toolchain.
```
./release/open_ubuntu_docker.sh
```
Then build pip packages for python 3.6 and 3.7 inside of the docker with:
```
./release/build_all_wheels.sh
exit
```

The resulting `.whl` files will be placed in a new folder outside of the docker called
`wheels`. From here they need to be repaired with `auditwheel` to ensure maximum
compatability across platforms. To repair the wheels run:
```
./release/repair_wheels.sh
```

Now the `wheels` folder should contain the built wheel files and the manylinux2010
version of the wheels for python 3.6 and 3.7.

A wheel can be installed with:
```
python3 -m pip install --user wheels/name_of_wheel.whl
```

Note, that if you are planning on running TFQ as a PIP package instead of
with Bazel, you cannot run from the tensorflow_quantum/ directory, or python will attempt
to use the local files instead of the site-package/ files and fail to find
dependencies.
