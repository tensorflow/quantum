"""TensorFlow Quantum adds qauntum computing primitives to TensorFlow.

TensorFlow Quantum is an open source library for high performance batch
quantum computation on quantum simulators and quantum computers. The goal
of TensorFlow Quantum is to help researchers develop a deeper understanding
of quantum data and quantum systems via hybrid models.

TensorFlow Quantum was created in an ongoing collaboration between the
University of Waterloo and the Quantum AI team at Google along with help from
many other contributors within Google.
