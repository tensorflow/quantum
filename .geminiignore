# Summary: tell Gemini CLI it should (or should not) ignore certain files and
# folders. Gemini CLI reads .gitignore too, but .geminiignore takes precedence
# -- useful for un-ignoring files that shouldn't be committed to git yet should
# be visible to Gemini CLI. (Note also a different file, .aiexclude, is read by
# Gemini Code Assist.) See https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/gemini-ignore/.

# Don't ignore the Bazel config files created by configure.sh.
