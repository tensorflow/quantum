[TensorFlow Quantum](https://www.tensorflow.org/quantum) (TFQ) is a Python
framework for hybrid quantum-classical machine learning that is primarily
focused on modeling quantum data. TFQ is an application framework developed to
allow quantum algorithms researchers and machine learning applications
researchers to explore computing workflows that leverage Googleâ€™s quantum
computing offerings, all from within TensorFlow.


## Motivation

Quantum computing at Google has hit an exciting milestone with the achievement
of [Quantum Supremacy](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1666-5).
In the wake of this demonstration, Google is now turning its attention to
developing and implementing new algorithms to run on its Quantum Computer
that have real world [applications](https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/10/quantum-supremacy-using-programmable.html).

To provide users with the tools they need to program and simulate a quantum
computer, Google is working on [Cirq](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq). Cirq
is designed for quantum computing researchers who are interested in running and
designing algorithms that leverage existing (imperfect) quantum computers.

TensorFlow Quantum provides users with the tools they need to interleave quantum
algorithms and logic designed in Cirq with the powerful and performant ML tools
from TensorFlow. With this connection we hope to unlock new and exciting paths
for Quantum Computing research that would not have otherwise been possible.
