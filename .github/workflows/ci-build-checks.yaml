  # 2024-11-30 [mhucka] temporarily turning off leak-tests because it produces
  # false positives on GH that we can't immediately address. TODO: if updating
  # TFQ to use Clang and the latest TF does not resolve this, find a way to
  # skip the handful of failing tests and renable the rest of the msan tests.
