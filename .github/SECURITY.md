# Reporting security issues

This project's developers and community are committed to addressing security
bugs promptly and effectively. We appreciate your efforts to disclose your
findings responsibly, and will make every effort to acknowledge your
contributions.

Please **do not** use GitHub issues to report security vulnerabilities; GitHub
issues are public, and doing so could allow someone to exploit the information
before the problem can be addressed. Instead, please use the *Report a
vulnerability* interface from the *Security* tab at the top of this GitHub
repository page.

Please report security issues in third-party modules to the person or team
maintaining the module rather than this project's stewards, unless you believe
that some action needs to be taken specifically with this project in order to
guard against the effects of a security vulnerability in third-party software.

## Responses to security reports

The project stewards at Google Quantum AI will send a response indicating the
next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the
project stewards will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full
announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

## Additional points of contact

Please contact the project stewards at Google Quantum AI via email at
quantum-oss-maintainers@google.com if you have questions or other concerns. If
for any reason you are uncomfortable reaching out to the project stewards,
please email opensource@google.com instead.
