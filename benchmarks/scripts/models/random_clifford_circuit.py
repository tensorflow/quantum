    Each layer will consist of a random number of one- or two-qubit Clifford
    gates acting on a random subset of qubits.
    Args:
        qubits: The sequence of GridQubits that the circuit should act on.
            Because the qubits on which an operation acts are chosen randomly,
            not all given qubits may be acted upon.
        n_moments: The number of moments in the generated circuit.
        op_density: the expected fraction of qubits acted on in each
            moment in half-open interval [0, 1].
        random_state: Optional random state or random state seed.

    Returns:
        Clifford circuit with randomly chosen and assigned gates.
